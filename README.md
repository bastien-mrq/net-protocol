# Net protocol
## Intoduction

This is a simple implementation  of a network protocol ovec TCP. 

I build it to understand how it work. 

The project is a Proof Of Concept and wasn't intended to be used in a project. 

## Improvements
I can see some improvment i can make :
- better error handling
- use the message type, diffrent parsing (file, object, image, ...)
